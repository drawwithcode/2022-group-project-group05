Since the rise of technology human relationships have really changed, and now it’s even possible to rely on algorithms to find  your soulmate. While in person we use a varicolored language, online we only communicate with combinations of 0 and 1. Nevertheless, the latter seems to work better.</br></br>

#### ***What if communicating directly like machines could help us find true love more easily? <3***

N01 is a web experience that allows you to ***find your soulmate only talking with one bit messages***. 
The project takes inspiration from the experiment held at Cornell University, called *Communicating Intimacy One Bit at a Time*, where chosen couples could only communicate using one bit messages. The idea behind N01 is the same one: The server connects two people; every time one of them touches the heart button, it generates a sound in the other person’s device. The purpose is to find each other and physically connect. N01 not only finds your match, but also your soulmate. As the ultimate love guru, N01 knows what’s best for you, but to get it you have to communicate with its language.

# ***Concept***

## Binary Code

The project has the aim to make *present* the basic language of every machine: *binary code*. 

N01 takes inspiration from the experiment held at Cornell University *Communicating Intimacy One Bit at a Time*, where chosen couples in long-distance relationships could only communicate using one bit messages. the results suggested  that even a one-bit communication device is seen by users as a valuable and rich channel for communicating intimacy, despite the availability of wider channels. In the same way N01 connects people and show them that even with the smaller amount of possibilities, you can connect and bond with someone. </br>

## Exhibition
![storyboard](README.img/storyboard.png)

The experience is designed as an interactive exhibition that takes place in a room. From the outside, people will be attracted by the pink soft lights. Before entering the room, the user reads the concept and can decide to join. A computer is placed right next the entrance and a QR code is displayed on its monitor. The user scans it and finally the experience begins. 


## Structure
The website can be divided into 3 different parts:
1. ***Homepage*** from which you can either go directly to the gallery part or start the experience <br>
2. ***Logging and matching*** which in turn can be divided into 4 parts <br>
   a. *Login and rules* of the experience <br>
   b. *Waiting list* where the user will be associated to another one <br>
   c. *Matching* actually with the assiociated <br>
   d. *Output* of the experience, generated by the inputs sent by the two partecipants<br>
3. ***Output and gallery*** where all the output will be displayed <br>

![structure](README.img/structure.png)

These parts corresponds to a flow composed of five html pages (the home, the login, the experience, the output and the gallery), each linked to a different css and a javascript file, plus three additional javascripts documents that add features common to all the pages. 
###

# ***Experience***

## Homepage
After scanning the QR code the first page visible is the homepage where you can start the experience. By opening the menu go directly to the final gallery, open the README file in the githup repository.</br>

<div align="center"> 
  <img src="README.img/homepage1.gif" width="30%"> 
  <img src="README.img/readmee.gif" width="30%">
</div> 

</br> The whole aesthetic of N01 is playful and a bit silly, taking inspiration from love calculator’s websites on old computers. Cheesy love quotes and heart patterns make N01 almost feel like a dating website. The experience is created to make people have fun and enjoy, but also to reflect on the metaphor behind it.</br></br>

#### ----------------------------------------------------- *code insights* -----------------------------------------------------

#### *dithered background*
To process the pixels of the canva the code is composed of three functions, one the callback of the other. 
In the function `draw` the context of the canvas is processed as an array of pixels and passed as an argument of the second function.

```javascript
//first function

ctx = p1.canvas.getContext('2d');

let gradient = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, valMapped, 0,  p1.height);
  gradient.addColorStop(0, userColor);
  gradient.addColorStop(1, "white");

let imageData = ctx.getImageData( 0, 0, p1.width, p1.height );
  dither(imageData, [imageData.data.buffer]);
```
The second function `clamps` the r, g, b values of the pixels of the canvas within a certain range to limit the color depth of the image. It then iters through two `for loop`, one within the other, to define a new array of pixels. 
The iterations `map` the range of values for each channel, that usuually goes from 0 to 255, to another range that is defined as an ` array of arrays ` at the beginning of the code.

```javascript 
//second function
function dither (imageData, []){
    // imageData
    const width = imageData.width;
    const pixels = imageData.data;
    const dither = dithers["rgb_4"];
    
    const intensity = (r, g, b) =>
    Math.floor(0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b);
    const clamp = (val, min, max) => Math.max(min, Math.min(val, max));
    const map = (val, min1, max1, min2, max2) =>
    ((val - min1) / (max1 - min1)) * (max2 - min2) + min2;
    
    const map = (val, min1, max1, min2, max2) => ((val - min1) / (max1 - min1)) * (max2 - min2) + min2;
    
    // filter
    for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
      const x = (i / 4) % width;
      const y = Math.floor(i / 4 / width);
      const colors = pixels.slice(i, i + 3);
    
      for (let c = 0; c < 3; c++) {
        const thresholdMap = thresholdMaps[dither.mapIndex[c]];
        const mapSide = thresholdMap.length;
        const mapSize = mapSide * mapSide ;
        const threshold = thresholdMap[x % mapSide][y % mapSide];
        const numColors = dither.colorCount[c];

        const color = Math.floor(
          clamp( (numColors * colors[c]) / 256 + threshold / mapSize - 0.5,  0, numColors - 1)
        );
        const nearestColor = Math.floor(map(color, 0, numColors - 1, 0, 255));
    
        pixels[i + c] = nearestColor;
      }
    }
    
    drawCanvas(ctx, imageData);
}
 ```
In the third function the array of pixels is then applied to the context of the original canvas to redraw its pixels. 

 ```javascript
//third function
function drawCanvas(cnv, img) {
    cnv.canvas.width = img.width;
    cnv.canvas.height = img.height;
    ctx.putImageData(img, 0, 0);
}
 
```

#### *heart animation*
The animation is defined as a method of a `class`. On `click` a new object is pushed into an array that is then itered in the draw function to apply the function to all of its elements.

```javascript
class Heart {
  constructor(x, y){
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
  }

  move() {

    this.y= this.y-4

    p1.push();
      p1.translate(this.x, this.y);
      p1.image(heartImage, 0, 0);
    p1.pop()
  }
}

//NEW HEART ON CLICK
document.addEventListener("click", function(){
  let xHeart= p1.mouseX-heartImage.width
  let yHeart= p1.mouseY-heartImage.height
  arrayHeart.push(new Heart(xHeart, yHeart))//al click aggiungo un cuore all'array
})
```

## Waiting and Matching

### Login
The first step requires to log into the web-site with the personal name or a nickname. This input is necessary both to render the final output and to save the artwork into the firebase gallery. <br> 
After the input some instructions guide the user into the next step of the experience.

### Waiting
While waiting for a match to be made, each user is assigned randomly a cheesy love quote.

<div align= "center">
  <img src="README.img/waiting1.gif" width="30%"/>
  <img src="README.img/waiting2.gif" width="30%"/>
  <img src="README.img/waiting3.gif" width="30%"/>
</div>

#### ----------------------------------------------------- *code insights* -----------------------------------------------------


```javascript
//takes the first two waiting users and pairs them
function pair() {
    console.log("pairing")
    let pairingUsers = [getUser(waiting[0]), getUser(waiting[1])]

    for (let i = 0; i < pairingUsers.length; i++){
        let user = pairingUsers[i]
        //assign paired id to users
        user.pairedId = pairingUsers[1 - i].id
        
        //assign colors to users
        user.assignColor()

        //start timers
        user.timer = setInterval(function () {
            user.updateMsg()
        }, CLOCK)
    }

    let msg = [{}, {}];

    for (let i = 0; i < msg.length; i++){
        //send users pair id
        msg[i].id = pairingUsers[1 - i].id

        //send users their color and color to search
        msg[i].userColor = pairingUsers[i].color
        msg[i].pairColor = pairingUsers[1 - i].color

        //send users color of paired
        msg[i].pairName = pairingUsers[1 - i].name

        //send the message
        io.to(pairingUsers[i].id).emit("paired", msg[i])
    }

    console.log(msg)

    console.log("paired " + pairingUsers[0].id + " and " + pairingUsers[1].id)
    waiting.splice(0, 2);
    console.log(waiting)
}
//takes the first two waiting users and pairs them
function pair() {
    console.log("pairing")
    let pairingUsers = [getUser(waiting[0]), getUser(waiting[1])]

    for (let i = 0; i < pairingUsers.length; i++){
        let user = pairingUsers[i]
        //assign paired id to users
        user.pairedId = pairingUsers[1 - i].id
        
        //assign colors to users
        user.assignColor()

        //start timers
        user.timer = setInterval(function () {
            user.updateMsg()
        }, CLOCK)
    }

    let msg = [{}, {}];

    for (let i = 0; i < msg.length; i++){
        //send users pair id
        msg[i].id = pairingUsers[1 - i].id

        //send users their color and color to search
        msg[i].userColor = pairingUsers[i].color
        msg[i].pairColor = pairingUsers[1 - i].color

        //send users color of paired
        msg[i].pairName = pairingUsers[1 - i].name

        //send the message
        io.to(pairingUsers[i].id).emit("paired", msg[i])
    }

    console.log(msg)

    console.log("paired " + pairingUsers[0].id + " and " + pairingUsers[1].id)
    waiting.splice(0, 2);
    console.log(waiting)
}
```

### Matching
When the match is made, the people have to start sending messages touching the heart button, that will result in a sound in the other person's device. The two people will have then to find one another physically, so the connection between the two is completed.  This is how the matching system works: <br>

```javascript
//takes the first two waiting users and pairs them
function pair() {
    console.log("pairing")
    waiting[0].pairedId = waiting[1].id
    waiting[1].pairedId = waiting[0].id
    unpaired -= 2;

    io.to(waiting[0].id).emit("paired", waiting[1])
    io.to(waiting[1].id).emit("paired", waiting[0])

    //start the users' timers
    for (let i = 0; i <= 1; i++){
        let user = getUser(waiting[i].id)
        user.timer = setInterval(function () {
            user.updateMsg()
        }, CLOCK)
    }

    console.log("paired " + waiting[0].id + " and " + waiting[1].id)
    waiting.splice(0, 2);
    console.log(waiting)
}
```
---

## Output and gallery

### Output
At the end of the experience the data sent by the two users are stored in the `local.storage` of the website and used to render an artwork. The image consists of a pixeleted-heart divided in two half, and it is obtained by itering the inputs of the two users, saved as elements of an `array`, into another `for loop` that draws the shape of the heart. </br>

```javascript

function graphicOutput(){//////OUTPUT

  outp= p1.createGraphics(p1.width*3/4, p1.height/3);

  let size = (outp.width/2) / rows;//definisco la dimensione in base alla width della canvas
  let myindex = 0;

  outp.push()
  for (let i = 0; i < grid1[0].length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < grid1.length; j++) {
      if (grid1[j][i] == 1) {
        if (message1[myindex] == 1) outp.fill("white");
        else outp.fill(color1);
        outp.noStroke()
        outp.square(i *size + size/2, j *size, size);
        myindex++;
      }
    }
  }
  outp.pop()

  outp.push()
  for (let i = 0; i < grid2[0].length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < grid2.length; j++) {
      if (grid2[j][i] == 1) {
        if (message2[myindex] == 1) outp.fill("white");
        else outp.fill(color2);
        outp.noStroke()
        outp.square(i *size +(outp.width/2)-size/2, j *size, size);
        myindex++;
      }
    }
  }
  outp.pop()
  
  outp.fill(255);
  outp.textSize(30);
  outp.textFont(Redaction)
  outp.textAlign(outp.CENTER)
  outp.text(names, outp.width/2, outp.height)
}

```

The artwork is generated as a `p5.Graphics` in the setup and rendered as an image into the draw function of two different `p5 sketches`:
-`p1` the main canvas, downloadable by the user as a png file in their device
-`p2` secondary hidden canvas, created to save the artwork into the Firebase database. This second canva is indeed processed with the method `getImageData` and exported as an `url` to the javascript file linked to firebase.
</br>

```javascript
p1 = new p5(sketch) //MAIN CANVA

p1.draw = function (){

  p1.canvas.id = "bgCanvas"

  //other lines of code

  p1.image(outp, (windowWidth-outp.width)/2,  (windowHeight-outp.height)/2);
}


p2 = new p5(sketch); //SECONDARY CANVA

p2.draw = function (){
  p2.resizeCanvas(windowWidth*3/4, windowHeight/3);
  p2.canvas.id= "output";
  p2.canvas.style.display="none";

  p2.image(outp, 0,0);//disegno l'artwork

  artwork = p2.canvas.toDataURL();//converto l'artwork in una stringa da salvare nel database

  writeUserData(names, artwork)//chiamo la funzione di firebase che salva l'artwork con il nome dello user

  p2.noLoop()
}
```

Firebase function are indeed imported in an external javascript file of type module. Both the functions and the variables are imported and exported from this file into the gallery.js and the output.js documents to set and get the objects saved into the database. Set is used to add an object to the gallery, get to obtain an array of all the elements contained under a certain #key into the database.

### Happy endings
The gallery is made with a Firebase realtime database that allow the users to check out all their matches few seconds after the update
This is how we used firebase for the final gallery:

```javascript
import { artwork } from "/public/JS/firebase.js"

//function that controls when datas get imported from database every 100 milliseconds
let loadingTime = setInterval( ()=>{

  if (artwork!=undefined){ //if the atwork exists the gallery gets generated 

    setTimeout( galleryCreation ,1800)
    clearInterval(loadingTime, loadingQuotes);

  } else quotesDisplay //or the loading animation gets called 

}, 100)


let outputs= []
let container= document.getElementById("img-ctn")

function galleryCreation () {
  
  document.body.classList.add("active"); //change div's flex
  (document.getElementById("loading")).style.display="none";

  //generates an array from database's datas
  outputs= Object.keys(artwork).map( function(key) {
      return artwork[key];
    });

  outputs.forEach(element => {
    
    let imgdata= document.createElement("img")
    
    imgdata.src= element.data;
    imgdata.classList.add("artwork");
    
    container.appendChild(imgdata);
    document.body.appendChild(imgdata);

  })
}
```
